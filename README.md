## Installation
1) Download repository
2) Run 'npm init' in command prompt after downloading

## Usage
When run, the user is asked to enter 1-3 characters for their logo. They are then asked what color to make those characters. After that, they'll be prompted for a shape (square, circle, or triangle) and what color it should be. The color can be either a color keyword that's accepted by SVG OR a hexadecimal number. For a list of apporpriate color keywords, [click here](https://johndecember.com/html/spec/colorsvg.html).

Once the user as answered all four questions, a `logo.svg` file is generated and saved to the `new_SVG-file` folder. The command line will also show "Generated logo.svg".
